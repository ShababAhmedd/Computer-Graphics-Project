Based on the time given by user, the position and size of the sun changes in the sky. Also based on time, the colour intensity of the sky and the sun changes.
<H3>Libraries used:</H3>
1) OpenGL <br>
2) NumPy

<h3>Algorithms used:</h3>
1) Mid Point Line Drawing Algorithm <br>
2) Mid-Point Circle Drawing Algorithm <br>
3) 8-Way Symmetry & Bresenham's Circle Algorithm <br>
4) Zone Conversion Algorithm.

And some Scaling matrix were used to make the sun small and large.
